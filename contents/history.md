Question comes up now that how did it get started and who built this essential tool for us?

•	After Russia launched the first manmade satellite “The Sputlink”, Americans realized they have to progress further in growing scientific and technology field. 

•	America set up organizations such as the and the Defense’s Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to address inventions in space and computing technology.

•	There was also worry on what would happen if nation was under attack and nation’s phone lines were damaged. In this case America will be without any communications. 

Timeline of the Invention

•	1965 – Scientist Joseph Licklider proposed a solution where computers could talk to one another. This would allow government organizations to communicate with each other even though the telephone systems were destroyed.

•	1965 – ARPA invests $1 millions in this program. Scientist Lawrence Roberts and Thomas Merrill communicate with one another using computer connected why a low speed dial up telephone line, creating the 1st wide area network and laying the groundwork for the Internet. 

•	1969 – The first version of Internet called ARPAnet was created and connected to computers at Stanford and UCLA.

•	1971 – Ray Tomlinson invents the EMAIL. He came up with the idea of sending electronic mail as well as using “@” symbol.
