The Internet Protocols and Data Transfer

### Description

•	In this section of the web page, I will be reviewing the various protocols that works at different layer of the internet. It includes following.

•	Transmission control protocol (TCP) is a communication standard which allows computing devices to exchange message over a network. It allows packets to be send over to internet for successful delivery of any data / messages.

•	Internet Protocol (IP) is the method of sending data from one device to any specific device over the internet. Just as you would have physical unique address, there is an IP address of each network connected device to receive the message. 

•	Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) allows users to connect with website when they type http:// domain name. It uses TCP to send and receive data.

•	 Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) allows users to connect with website when they type https:// domain name. It also uses TCP to send and receive data, however this is more secure as it transmits data over encrypted connection 

•	Network layer protocol (IPv4 vs IPv6) – This is the protocol that allows assigning IP addressed to devices that are connected to network.
