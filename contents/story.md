The Story of Internet

### Description

One of the reason Internet became so popular and widely acceptable is due to invention of Internet browsers. These web browsers opened a gateway for people to access various site that were easy to use and interactive.

   ###### Browser War

•	In late 1990s – First web browser called “WorldWideWeb” was created by Tim Burners Lee. This web browser was very simple and plain text based. This was later renamed to Nexus.

•	In 1993 – Mosaic was developed by Marc Andreessen, Rob McCool and their friends at NCSA. Mosaic was the first web browser with graphical user interface. This allowed user to see images along with the text.

•	In 1995 – Marc Andreessen left NCSA and started his own company which developed Netscape Navigator. 

•	August 1995 – Microsoft finally entered the web browsing with the launch of their Internet Explorer. This is where browser war started.

•	Microsoft made their Internet Explorer 2.0 free for all residential and commercial users. Other web browse red followed the same path. However, Microsoft was dominating PC market share and it helped them when they made Internet Explorer default browser.

•	With the advantage of Microsoft having over 90% of market share in 1990s, it became too difficult for Mosaic, Netscape or any other web browser to compete against them.

•	From 2021 point of view, below is the image indicating web browser market share.

  ###### Search Engine

Search engine is an Internet program which provides users a various web pages or links based on the keyword they searched for. This is basically Internet directory which guides user to a website based on content they are looking for.

   ###### Dotcom Bubble

The Dotcom bubble also known as the Internet bubble burst during the years of 2000 to 2002.
